## Summary
For our fifth project, we created a single page app to register as a new colonist on Mars.  We used Angular 2 JS to build our web app as well as SASS and Typescript. The features of our single webpage include a home and registration page, an alien encounters and reports page and a blog page.

## Languages and tools used:
- Angular 2 JS
- Angular CLI (Broccoli)
- Typescript
- CSS/SASS
- Node JS
- Git/Github
- WP REST API v2
- Postman
- Firebase

## What did I learn?
This project helped reinforce some of the concepts we learned during our React project. A few similarities I noticed between Angular 2 and React was the modular organization of files, the use of routes to a main file, and the ability to bind different functions to events in HTML.

This project focused a lot on pulling data from API's. We used an app called Postman this time to look at the API's objects and arrays, making it easier to look at the data.
